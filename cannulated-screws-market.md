<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cannulated Screws Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Headed Cannulated Screws</li><li>Headless Cannulated Screws</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cannulated screws are medical devices used in orthopedic surgeries to fix bones. Headed cannulated screws have a visible head that can be easily manipulated and tightened, providing stability to the bone. On the other hand, headless cannulated screws do not have a visible head, allowing for a flush insertion into the bone, reducing the risk of soft tissue irritation and offering a more aesthetic appearance. Both types of cannulated screws play a crucial role in bone fixation surgeries, but they differ in terms of visibility and potential soft tissue irritation.</p></p>
