<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anticancer Drugs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cytotoxic Drugs (Alkylating Agents, and Antimetabolites)</li><li>Targeted Drugs (Monoclonal Antibodies and Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors)</li><li>Hormonal Drugs</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Anticancer drugs can be categorized into three main types. The first type is cytotoxic drugs, which include alkylating agents and antimetabolites. Alkylating agents work by damaging the DNA of cancer cells, while antimetabolites disrupt the metabolic processes necessary for cell division. The second type is targeted drugs, which consist of monoclonal antibodies that recognize specific cancer cell proteins, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which block the signals that promote cancer cell growth. The third type is hormonal drugs, which interfere with hormone activity to prevent or slow down the growth of hormone-sensitive cancers.</p></p>
