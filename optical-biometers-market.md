<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Optical Biometers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Type</li><li>Non-contact Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Optical biometers are devices used in ophthalmology to measure various parameters of the eye, such as its length and curvature. The market for optical biometers can be categorized into two types: contact type and non-contact type. Contact type biometers require physical contact with the eye during measurement, utilizing ultrasound waves or mechanical probes. Conversely, non-contact type biometers do not require any contact and employ optical technologies like interferometry or partial coherence interferometry. Both types provide accurate measurements for determining the appropriate intraocular lens power for cataract surgery.</p></p>
