<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Enhanced Gas Recovery Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Nitrogen Based EGR</li><li>Carbon Dioxide Based EGR</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Enhanced Gas Recovery (EGR) refers to the process of injecting various gases into an underground reservoir to increase the extraction of natural gas or oil. There are different types of EGR, including Nitrogen Based EGR, Carbon Dioxide Based EGR, and Others. Nitrogen Based EGR involves injecting nitrogen gas into the reservoir to maintain pressure, displace oil/gas, and reduce viscosity. Carbon Dioxide Based EGR involves injecting carbon dioxide, which not only helps maintain pressure but also dissolves into oil, enhancing its mobility and ultimately increasing recovery. The "Others" category includes different gases like methane or natural gas liquids (NGL) utilized for EGR purposes.</p></p>
