<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Centrifugal Separator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquid-Liquid Separation</li><li>Liquid-Solid Separation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Centrifugal separator market includes two main types: liquid-liquid separation and liquid-solid separation. Liquid-liquid separation refers to the separation of two immiscible liquids based on their different densities. This is achieved by utilizing the centrifugal force generated when the mixture is rapidly rotated. On the other hand, liquid-solid separation involves the separation of solid particles from a liquid medium using the same principle. The centrifugal force causes the solid particles to settle at the bottom of the separator, allowing the clean liquid to be extracted from the top.</p></p>
