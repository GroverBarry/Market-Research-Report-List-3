<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Peritoneal Dialysis Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Power Type</li><li>Gravity Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Peritoneal dialysis machines are used for the treatment of kidney failure. Market types for these machines include power type and gravity type. Power type machines use electrical power to pump the dialysis fluid into and out of the abdomen, while gravity type machines use the force of gravity to move the fluid. Both types of machines work by using a catheter to fill the abdomen with dialysis fluid, which then filters waste and excess fluid from the blood. These machines provide options for patients to receive peritoneal dialysis treatment based on their specific needs and preferences.</p></p>
