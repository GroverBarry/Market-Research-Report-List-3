<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Smart Wristband Battery Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Traditional Button Battery</li><li>Rechargeable Lithium Battery</li></ul></p>
<p><p>There are two types of batteries commonly used in smart wristbands: traditional button batteries and rechargeable lithium batteries. Traditional button batteries are small, non-rechargeable batteries that need to be replaced once they run out of power. On the other hand, rechargeable lithium batteries can be recharged multiple times using a charging cable, eliminating the need for replacements. Both types of batteries serve the same purpose of powering the smart wristband, but the rechargeable lithium battery offers greater convenience and cost-effectiveness in the long run.</p></p>
