<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intelligent Range Hood Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Side Suction</li><li>Direct Suction</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Intelligent range hoods come in two main types - side suction and direct suction. Side suction range hoods pull in smoke and cooking fumes through vents on the sides of the hood, making them ideal for kitchens with limited space above the cooktop. On the other hand, direct suction range hoods use a powerful fan to draw in air directly from the cooktop, ensuring maximum efficiency in capturing smoke and odors. Both types offer advanced features such as automated controls and smart sensors for a more convenient cooking experience.</p></p>
