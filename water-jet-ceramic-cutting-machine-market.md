<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Water-jet Ceramic Cutting Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Abrasive Water-jet</li><li>Pure Water-jet</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Water-jet Ceramic Cutting Machine market consists of two types: Abrasive Water-jet and Pure Water-jet. </p><p>Abrasive Water-jet machines employ a stream of water mixed with fine abrasive particles to cut through ceramic materials effectively. The abrasive particles enhance the cutting process by increasing the velocity and erosive power of the water stream. These machines are ideal for cutting tough and thick ceramic materials.</p><p>On the other hand, Pure Water-jet machines use only a high-pressured stream of water to cut ceramics. The pure water stream possesses enough kinetic energy to achieve precise cuts on thinner and more delicate ceramic surfaces, eliminating the need for abrasive particles.</p></p>
