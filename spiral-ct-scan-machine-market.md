<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spiral CT Scan Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Double layer Helical CT Scanner</li><li>Multi Layer Helical CT Scanner</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Spiral CT scan machines are classified into two major types: double layer helical CT scanners and multi-layer helical CT scanners. The double layer helical CT scanner uses two detectors to capture cross-sectional images of the body simultaneously. This allows for faster scanning and reduces motion artifacts. On the other hand, the multi-layer helical CT scanner utilizes multiple rows of detectors to capture more slices in a single rotation. This enables higher resolution imaging and faster scanning time, improving patient comfort and diagnostic accuracy.</p></p>
