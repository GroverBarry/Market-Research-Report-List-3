<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mechanical Liner Hanger Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rotating Type</li><li>Non-Rotating Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Mechanical Liner Hanger Systems market is categorized into two types: Rotating Type and Non-Rotating Type. The Rotating Type liner hangers allow for the rotation of the liner during installation, facilitating better cementing and reducing the risk of differential sticking. On the other hand, Non-Rotating Type liner hangers do not permit rotation of the liner but still provide secure hanging of the liner. Both types offer different benefits and are used in various applications within the oil and gas industry.</p></p>
