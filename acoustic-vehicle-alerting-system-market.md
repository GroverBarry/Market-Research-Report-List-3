<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Acoustic Vehicle Alerting System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Seperated AVAS</li><li>Integrated AVAS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Acoustic Vehicle Alerting System (AVAS) market can be classified into two types: Separated AVAS and Integrated AVAS. Separated AVAS refers to a system where the sound generation unit is separate from the vehicle and is installed externally, often underneath the vehicle. In contrast, Integrated AVAS integrates the sound generation unit within the vehicle, requiring no additional external components. Both types aim to provide necessary audible alerts to pedestrians and other road users to ensure safety in electric vehicles, but differ in their installations.</p></p>
