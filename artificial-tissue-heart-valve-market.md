<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Artificial Tissue Heart Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Transcatheter Heart Valve</li><li>Surgical Heart Valve</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Artificial Tissue Heart Valve market consists of two types: Transcatheter Heart Valve and Surgical Heart Valve. Transcatheter Heart Valve refers to a minimally invasive procedure where an artificial valve is inserted through a catheter without the need for open-heart surgery. This type offers reduced risk and faster recovery time. On the other hand, Surgical Heart Valve involves the replacement of a damaged valve through open-heart surgery. This type is considered more invasive but provides a durable and stable solution for patients with heart valve disorders.</p></p>
