<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PUR Hot-Melt Adhesives Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Reactive PUR Hot-Melt Adhesives</li><li>Reactive PUR Hot-Melt Adhesives</li></ul></p>
<p><p>PUR hot-melt adhesives are divided into two main types: non-reactive and reactive. Non-reactive PUR hot-melt adhesives do not chemically react after application and primarily rely on physical bonding mechanisms for adhesion. They offer fast curing times, excellent creep resistance, and high bond strengths. On the other hand, reactive PUR hot-melt adhesives contain a chemical cross-linking agent that reacts with moisture in the environment, forming a strong, permanent bond. This type of adhesive provides enhanced heat resistance, chemical resistance, and durability. Both types find applications in various industries like automotive, packaging, and woodworking.</p></p>
