<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aquaculture Vaccines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oral Vaccines</li><li>Injectable Vaccines</li><li>Immersion Vaccines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Aquaculture vaccines include oral vaccines, injectable vaccines, and immersion vaccines. Oral vaccines are administered orally, either by mixing them with food or water, to provide immune protection. Injectable vaccines are injected into the fish's body, usually in the muscle, to induce immunity. Immersion vaccines involve immersing the fish in a specially formulated vaccine solution, allowing the fish to absorb the vaccine through their skin and gills. These different types of vaccines aim to protect fish from various diseases and enhance their overall health and survival rates in aquaculture settings.</p></p>
