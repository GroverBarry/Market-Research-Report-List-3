<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Membranes for Guided Tissue and Bone Regeneration Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable Membrane</li><li>Non-resorbable Membrane</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Membranes for guided tissue and bone regeneration are used in dental and medical procedures to promote the growth of new tissue or bone. There are two main types of membranes on the market: absorbable and non-resorbable. Absorbable membranes break down over time and are eventually absorbed by the body, while non-resorbable membranes remain in place permanently. Both types of membranes play a crucial role in aiding the body's natural healing process and are essential tools in promoting tissue and bone regeneration.</p></p>
