<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Shock Absorbers for Railways Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Axle Box Shock Absorber</li><li>Pillow Damper (Central Damper)</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The railway shock absorber market consists of two main types: axle box shock absorbers and pillow dampers (central dampers). Axle box shock absorbers are designed to reduce vibrations and protect the axle box from excessive forces during train movements. They effectively absorb shocks and impacts, increasing passenger comfort and reducing maintenance costs. On the other hand, pillow dampers, also known as central dampers, are installed between the bogie frame and the car body to minimize vertical and lateral vibrations. They improve ride quality, stability, and safety of the train.</p></p>
