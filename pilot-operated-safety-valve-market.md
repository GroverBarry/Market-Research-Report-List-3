<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pilot Operated Safety Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Closed Type</li><li>Non-closed Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The pilot operated safety valve market can be classified into two types: closed type and non-closed type. Closed type safety valves are designed to close automatically once the pressure reaches the set limit, providing reliable protection against over-pressure situations. On the other hand, non-closed type safety valves remain partially open even after reaching the set pressure limit, allowing excess pressure to escape continuously. Both types are crucial in preventing equipment damage and ensuring the safety of personnel in industries where pressure regulation is vital.</p></p>
