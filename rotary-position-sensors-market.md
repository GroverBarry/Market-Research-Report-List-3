<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rotary Position Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Rotary Position Sensors</li><li>Non-Contact Rotary Position Sensors</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Rotary position sensors are devices used to measure the angular position of a rotating object. There are two types of rotary position sensors: contact and non-contact. Contact rotary position sensors, also known as potentiometers, use physical contact between a rotating element and a fixed component to determine the position. Non-contact rotary position sensors, such as optical or magnetic sensors, do not require direct contact and instead use light or magnetic fields to measure position. Both types have their own advantages and applications in various industries.</p></p>
