<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Refrigerated Truck Refrigeration Units Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Detached</li><li>Dependent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Refrigerated truck refrigeration units are divided into two types: detached and dependent. Detached units are self-contained and can operate independently from the truck's engine, providing cooling during transportation and even when the vehicle is idle. They are more expensive but offer flexibility in terms of truck selection. Dependent units, on the other hand, rely on the truck's engine to power the refrigeration system. These units are less expensive but can only provide cooling while the truck's engine is running. The choice between the two types depends on the specific requirements and budget of the user.</p></p>
