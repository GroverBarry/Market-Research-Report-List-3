<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Veterinary Breathing Circuits Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-open Veterinary Breathing Circuits</li><li>Open Veterinary Breathing Circuits</li><li>Closed Veterinary Breathing Circuits</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The veterinary breathing circuits market is segmented into three types: semi-open, open, and closed circuits. Semi-open circuits allow the exchange of gases between the patient and the environment. Open circuits allow the release of exhaled gases into the surrounding area without rebreathing them. Closed circuits recirculate exhaled gases back to the patient after being filtered, removing waste gases. Each type offers different advantages and is used based on the specific needs of the veterinary procedure.</p></p>
