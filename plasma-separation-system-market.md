<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Plasma Separation System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Membrane Separation Type</li><li>Centrifugal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Plasma Separation System market includes two types: Membrane Separation Type and Centrifugal market. Membrane Separation Type involves the use of a semipermeable membrane to separate plasma from blood components based on their size and molecular weight. This method is less invasive and offers greater selectivity. On the other hand, the Centrifugal market uses a centrifuge to separate plasma from blood cells by spinning the blood sample at high speeds. This method is faster but requires larger equipment and is more complex than membrane separation.</p></p>
