<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Welded Hydraulic Cylinder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Acting</li><li>Double Acting</li><li>Multi-Stage/ Tandem</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The welded hydraulic cylinder market includes three main types: single acting, double acting, and multi-stage/tandem cylinders. Single acting cylinders have one direction of force or movement, typically in extending or retracting the cylinder. Double acting cylinders can generate force in both directions, allowing for both extending and retracting of the cylinder. Multi-stage/tandem cylinders contain multiple pistons that function in stages, providing increased force output. These cylinders are commonly used in applications where higher force requirements are needed to perform tasks efficiently.</p></p>
