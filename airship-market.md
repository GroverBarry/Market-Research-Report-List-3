<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Airship Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rigid</li><li>Semi Rigid</li><li>Non-rigid</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The airship market can be classified into three types: rigid, semi-rigid, and non-rigid. Rigid airships have a strong internal structure made of a rigid framework that maintains the airship's shape, commonly known as zeppelins. Semi-rigid airships have a partial rigid framework that supports the structure but allows for some flexibility. Non-rigid airships, also known as blimps, have no rigid structure and rely solely on the pressure of the gas to maintain shape. Each type has its own advantages and applications in areas such as transportation, surveillance, and advertising.</p></p>
