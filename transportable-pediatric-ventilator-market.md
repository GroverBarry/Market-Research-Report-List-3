<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Transportable Pediatric Ventilator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intrusive</li><li>Non-invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The transportable pediatric ventilator market includes two types: intrusive and non-invasive. Intrusive ventilators require the placement of a tube through the mouth or nose into the airway, delivering controlled breaths directly to the lungs. Non-invasive ventilators, on the other hand, deliver assistive breaths through a mask or nasal interface, eliminating the need for invasive placement. Both types provide respiratory support to pediatric patients during transportation, offering different methods of delivering oxygen and maintaining airflow for their breathing needs.</p></p>
