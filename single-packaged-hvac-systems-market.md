<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Single Packaged HVAC Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air-Cooled Systems</li><li>Water-Cooled Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Single packaged HVAC systems refer to heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems that come in one compact unit, suitable for individual spaces. Air-cooled systems use outdoor air to transfer heat, while water-cooled systems utilize water as the heat transfer medium. Air-cooled systems are more common and easy to install, requiring less maintenance, but they are less efficient. Water-cooled systems, on the other hand, offer higher efficiency and better control over temperature and humidity levels but require a water source and additional plumbing.</p></p>
