<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Bipolar Transistors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>NPN</li><li>PNP</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive bipolar transistors market consists of two main types: NPN and PNP. NPN transistors are composed of three layers of semiconductor material and function with a positive voltage at the base relative to the emitter, allowing for the flow of current between the collector and emitter. PNP transistors, on the other hand, operate with a negative voltage at the base relative to the emitter. This differs from NPN transistors as the current flows in the opposite direction, allowing for amplification and control of electrical signals in automotive applications.</p></p>
