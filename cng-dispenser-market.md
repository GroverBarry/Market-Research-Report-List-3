<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CNG Dispenser Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fast Fill</li><li>Time Fill</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The CNG dispenser market is divided into two main types: fast fill and time fill. Fast fill refers to a type of dispenser that rapidly fills the vehicle's CNG tanks, allowing vehicles to refuel in a similar timeframe to conventional gasoline or diesel refueling. Time fill, on the other hand, involves slower refueling, taking advantage of extended periods of vehicle downtime, such as overnight, to gradually fill the tanks. This method is commonly used for fleets of vehicles that can be parked for longer periods.</p></p>
